# RegressionUsingFullyConnectedNN_2Linear_ReLU
implementing Linear Regression using neural network with two linear layer and a ReLU activation function included
### note 
hiddenlayer is a graphical simulator that can implement different layers of neural network for better understanding you might have some problems with it in that case,
you can go to pytorch_builder.py source file and change _optimize_trace to _optimize_graph this will solve the problem or you can simply comment this part and skip it
